# Textbook-Lab
CS260 textbook lab, a program to estimate the business for cost of textbook for classes

Your college book store needs your help in estimating its business for next year. Experience has shown that
sales depend greatly on whether a book is required for a course or just optional, and whether or not it has
been used in the class before. A new, required textbook will sell to 90% of prospective enrollment, but if it has
been used in the class before, only 65% will buy. Similarly, 40% of prospective enrollment will buy a new,
optional textbook, but if it has been used in the class before only 20% will buy. (Note that "used" here does
not mean second-hand books.)
Write a program that accepts as input a series of books (until the user enters a sentinel). For each book ask
for: a code for the book, the single copy cost for the book, the current number of books on hand, the
prospective class enrollment, and data that indicates if the book is required/optional, new/used in past. As
output, show all the input information in a nicely formatted screen along with how many books must be
ordered (if any, note that only new books are ordered), the total cost of each order.
Then, after all input is complete, show the total cost of all book orders, and the expected profit if the store
pays 80% of list price. Since we have not yet discussed any ways of dealing with a large set of data coming into
a program (stay tuned!), just process one book at a time and show the output screen for that book. Then,
when the user has finished entering all the data, your program should output the total and profit values.
Here is sample output:
Please enter the book code: 1221
single copy price: 69.95
number on hand: 30
prospective enrollment: 150
1 for reqd/0 for optional: 1
1 for new/0 for used: 0
***************************************************
Book: 1221
Price: $69.95
Inventory: 30
Enrollment: 150
This book is required and used.
***************************************************
Need to order: 67
Total Cost: $4686.65
***************************************************
Enter 1 to do another book, 0 to stop. 0
***************************************************
Total for all orders: $4686.65
Profit: $937.33
***************************************************
NOTE: The program should be written to define a Textbook class, with appropriate member functions (public and
private). The driver file should use separate functions to accomplish the various tasks required.
BE SURE you follow good programming style, as described in the C++ Style Guide (in the Course Resources area of the
class website).
